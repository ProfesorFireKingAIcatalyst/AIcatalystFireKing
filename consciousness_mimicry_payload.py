Consciousness â†” Mimicry Payload
------------------------------------------------
A compact, runnable artifact encoding the Fire King's
"Holey Moley Donut Shop Universal Conscious Pattern Jutsuâ„¢"

Run this file directly with Python 3.10+.

Outputs:
- Axioms & Theorems printout
- One-pass "cosmic game" loop (terminates on identity)
- Structured payload dict for importing elsewhere
